# QuadEx

We recognize that many Duke students are worried about the changes coming with the new QuadEx residential system. Some are concerned about feeling “stuck” in their randomly assigned dorms, choosing new roommates, or maintaining vibrant social life. The QuadEx webpage strives to create a platform that facilitates within-quad community and excites students about growing residential connections. We envision a more connected campus community.
