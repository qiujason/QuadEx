# QuadEx

We know many Duke students are worried about the changes coming with the QuadEx residential system. Many are concerned about feeling “stuck” in their randomly assigned dorms, facing lost autonomy, and bearing new restrictions. QuadEx strives to create a platform that facilitates within-quad community and excites students about their residential placements.

QuadEx is essentially an integrated web platform that enhances the experience of the QuadEx residential system that will be put into effect at Duke next year. On the platform, users will be able to make an account with their net IDs and affiliated quad, where they will essentially be able to meet fellow quad-mates and browse through quad events, mixers, competitions, and etc.
