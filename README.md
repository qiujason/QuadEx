# QuadEx

We know many Duke students are worried about the changes coming with the QuadEx residential system. Many are concerned about feeling “stuck” in their randomly assigned dorms, facing lost autonomy, and bearing new restrictions. QuadEx strives to create a platform that facilitates within-quad community and excites students about their residential placements.
